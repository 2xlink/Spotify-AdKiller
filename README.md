# Spotify-AdKiller (for LINUX)

Your Party with Spotify - but without Ads!

We all love Spotify, but sometimes people (like me) want to throw a party without interrupting Ads before having bought premium. This is for testing purposes ONLY! Spotify is a fantastic service and worth every penny. This script is **NOT** meant to circumvent buying premium! Please do consider switching to premium to support Spotify - especially if you're going to use it on the move.

### Installation of the script

Move the script `adkiller.sh` to your PATH (e.g. $HOME/bin on openSUSE and Ubuntu) and use the wrapper script `wrapper.sh` to start the AdKiller automatically when Spotify gets started. You don't have to worry about terminating it when Spotify exits because that happens automatically.
